# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add `Tween<T>` describing a single tween animation, independently of its target (asset or component).
- Add `Tween<T>::is_paused()` to query when a tweening animation is in its pause phase, if any.
- Add `Tween<T>::direction()` to query the playback direction of a tweening animation (forward or backward).
- Add `Tween<T>::progress()` to query the progres ratio in [0:1] of a tweening animation.
- Enable multiple lenses per animator via "tracks", the ability to add multiple tween animations running in parallel on the same component.
- Enable sequences of tween animations running serially, one after the other, for each track of an animator, allowing to create more complex animations.

### Fixed

- Perform spherical linear interpolation (slerp) for `Quat` rotation of `Transform` animation via `TransformRotationLens`, instead of mere linear interpolation leaving the quaternion non-normalized.

## [0.2.0] - 2022-01-09

### Changed

- Update to Bevy 0.6
- Update to rust edition 2021
- Force Cargo resolver v2

### Added

- Added built-in lens `SpriteColorLens`, since the color of a `Sprite` is now an intrinsic property of the component in Bevy 0.6, and does not use `ColorMaterial` anymore.

## [0.1.0] - 2021-12-24

Initial version for Bevy 0.5
